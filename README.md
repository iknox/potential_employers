### Hello there!

I've recently stopped putting personal projects in public repos.  I made this decision partly to avoid them ending up in someone's AI training data, and partly because the mess they sometimes become makes me uneasy.

Thanks perfectionist brain. ðŸ™„

That said, if you would like to see some of my work all is not lost! I worked almost entirely in the public eye as a full time Senior OSS developer at dbt labs from 2021 through 2023.  I had a separate [GH account](https://github.com/iknox-fa) for my work there, so feel free to [poke through my commit history](https://github.com/iknox-fa?tab=overview&from=2021-12-01&to=2021-12-31).


Cheers,

Ian
